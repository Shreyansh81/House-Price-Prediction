# House-Price-Prediction
-by Shreyansh Jain, student from Birla Institute Of Technology, Mesra

This is my project on machine learning. Languages included : Python

Goal : To predict the price of the house.

Problem Statement :
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.

This project has following parts :
Exploratory Data Analysis : In this I pre processed the raw data into meaningful numeric data adn performed initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
Correlation : In this part I have showen how data is correlated with the help of heatmap.
Model Building : Here I split the train data into training and validation set so that it become easy to validate the results of our model on the validation set. We will keep 40% data as validation set and rest as the training set.
Machine Learning algorithm : To check the performance of my dataset I have used a machine learning techniques i.e Linear regression where I have predicted the Linear Regression model and evaluated the regression metrics (MAE, MASE, RMSE)
Dataset Attributes :
Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

a) 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of householder of the city house is located in. b) 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of Houses in same city. c) 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in same city. d) 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city. e) 'Area Population': Population of city. f) 'Price': Price that the house sold at. h) 'Address': Address of the houses.

Tools and Algorithms Used for Analysis :
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Linear Regression, Sklearn
